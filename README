ABOUT:

CDDB is a high-level interface to the Compact Disc Database at
<www.cddb.com>.  This code is in its late beta stage.  The interface
is gelling, and should remain backward compatible unless something
hideously wrong is found with it.

TO DO (in no particular order):

* gracefully handle the "too many connections today" close message
* LWP interface to www.cddb.com's search form
* DWIM interface (accept all manner of freeform input, and do whatever
  possible)

COMPATIBILITY:

CDDB.pm uses standard Perl modules.  It has been tested on OS/2, MacOS
and FreeBSD systems, as well as the systems listed at
<http://www.connect.net/gbarr/cpan-test/by-dist/CDDB.html>.

If you want to submit disc information to the CDDB, you will need to
install MailTools.  All other features will work without MailTools.

GETTING STARTED:

To build and test this distribution, type:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

If the tests pass, install it:

  make install
