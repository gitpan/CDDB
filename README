ABOUT:

CDDB is a high-level interface to the Compact Disc Database at
<www.cddb.com>.  This code is in its late beta stage.  Interface
development has quieted down, but it still may change before its CPAN
release.

TO DO :

* gracefully handle the "too many connections today" close message
* LWP interface to www.cddb.com's search form
* DWIM interface (accept all manner of freeform input, and do whatever
  possible)

COMPATIBILITY:

CDDB.pm uses standard Perl modules.  It has been tested on OS/2, MacOS
and FreeBSD systems.

If you want to submit disc information to the CDDB, you will need to
install MailTools.  All other features will work without MailTools.

AVAILABILITY:

Currently it is available only from the author.  The author ventures
to guess that version 0.06 will be uploaded to PAUSE.

GETTING STARTED:

To build and test this distribution, type:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

If the tests pass, install it:

  make install
