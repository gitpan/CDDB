*** 1.01 1999.07.16

Just as I was getting ready to celebrate a bug-free CDDB module, along
comes some Macintosh freak with spaces in his login ID (Hi, Schwern!).
So now the module squashes spaces and replaces them with underscores.
And if that isn't enough, CDDB's constructor now accepts an optional
Login parameter.


*** 1.00 1999.07.16

Whenever someone updates a CDDB record that cddb.t tests against, it
breaks the test.  It's a fairly harmless problem, but it does cause
CDDB not to pass its tests.  I'm fed up with it after a few
iterations, so I changed the hard "retrieved track offset != stored
one" tests with a more lenient "retrieved track offset within 5% of
stored one".

While I'm at it, make the title tests approximate by normalizing
whitespace and only comparing consonants.  Sort of an approximate
metaphone match.

Still to do: The genres and track-lengths tests haven't been made
fuzzy in this version.


*** 0.07-beta 1998.11.27

Added a list of CDDB servers inside CDDB.pm.  Added code to cycle
through the servers upon receipt of "417 Database access limit
reached" or connection errors.

Made t/cddb.t a little lamer for the sake of passing the fuzzy matches
tests.

Added information about the CDDB submission test to README.

Chris Nandor suggested a get_discs_after_calculating_id() macro
function.  Added it under the name get_discs_by_toc().

Whoops!  CDDB::message() was missing, but it was never called during
testing.  Until today.  Added CDDB::message().


*** 0.06-beta

Fixed newlines in submit_disc so they meet Net::Cmd expectations

Added the HISTORY file to track changes.
