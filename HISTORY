*** 0.07-beta 1998.11.27

Added a list of CDDB servers inside CDDB.pm.  Added code to cycle
through the servers upon receipt of "417 Database access limit
reached" or connection errors.

Made t/cddb.t a little lamer for the sake of passing the fuzzy matches
tests.

Added information about the CDDB submission test to README.

Chris Nandor suggested a get_discs_after_calculating_id() macro
function.  Added it under the name get_discs_by_toc().

Whoops!  CDDB::message() was missing, but it was never called during
testing.  Until today.  Added CDDB::message().


*** 0.06-beta

Fixed newlines in submit_disc so they meet Net::Cmd expectations

Added the HISTORY file to track changes.
